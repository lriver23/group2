# Group 2

## Purpose
This is a project created for [DePaul SE452](http://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/pages/courseinfo.aspx?Subject=SE&CatalogNbr=452), developed by group 2. The project is being developed as an e-commerce store, similar to something like Amazon's online store.

<br>
* Milestone 1: Define the project and base structure and areas where each members will be working on

## Project Members

| Member | Area  |
| ----------- | ----------- 
| Louis | Inventory Management |


<br/>

## Conflict Resolution
There are currently three members of group 2 so in case a major conflict holds us up and needs to be resolved, a majority in favor of an option will be how we resolve the conflict.

<br/>

## Communication Mechanism
We are using WhatsApp for communication currently. Some of our members are in the online class and some are in the in-person class so we don't have a set time for meetings currently. We can setup meetings though and hold them over Zoom or WhatsApp if we have aspects of the project we need to discuss that are too combersome to discuss through messaging.

## Decision Made
| # | Area  | Decision | Alternative | Rationale
| ----------- | ----------- | --- | --- |--- |
| 1| IDE | Use VS Code |IntelliJ, Eclipse | VS code is easily extandable to work well with Spring and Java through plugins. It's also lightweight so it should work on most machines.
| 2 | Code  | Lombok | Type it out manually | Lombok is a good time saver that saves you from having to type out large amounts of boilerplate code.
| 3 | Dependency Management  | Gradle | Maven | build.gradle files are more compact and easier to write than pom.xml files.
| 4 | Configuration Management  | Yaml | Properties | Easier to view groups of configuration
